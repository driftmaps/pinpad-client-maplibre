We have tiles for testing in tiles.zip. It is a zipping of a directory structured like this, with tiles in z/x/y format:
```
tiles
â”œâ”€â”€ data
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ 10               // z
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ 300          // x
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ 364.pbf  // y
```

I may have had to manually drop this file in place via Xcode to get things working for iOS, not sure.d

# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
